# Java-II-Project
  A final project for and advanced college course in Java. The application is meant to replicate an appointment tracking application for a fictitious medical company with locations in U.S., Canada, and Europe. 
  The application utilizes a MySQL server to keep track of user login information, appointments, customers, customer contacts, as well as country and country division information. The server was hosted locally and will not be fully functional without it, but the SQL scripts for building and populating the database are provided in the databaseScripts folder.
